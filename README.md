# TSS-Merge
This is a possible solution to merge overlapping intervals written in Java.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project was written with Java 11. To avoid any problems make sure Java 11 is installed on your machine.
Otherwise, you can download it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html).

Clone this repository to your local machine and open it in the IDE of your choice.
I recommend using [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/#section=windows) since I am using it to work on this project.

### Run the Project
To run the project there are two ways:
1. Open your terminal, move to ```TSS-Merge/out/artifacts/TSS_Merge_jar/``` and run:
    ```
    java -jar TSS_Merge.jar
    ```
2. For testing purposes I prepared some data in the main-method. Therefore, you should run the project with the run option in your IDE. In IntelliJ go to ```Run > Run MergeIntervals```.
